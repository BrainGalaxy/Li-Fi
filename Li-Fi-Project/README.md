# 🔦 Li-Fi Communication Project (C Language)

Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) is a wireless communication technology that uses
LED light instead of radio waves to transmit data.

This project demonstrates a basic Li-Fi system using:
- LED as transmitter
- LDR as receiver
- Embedded C and standard C logic

## 📁 Project Structure
- src/transmitter → LED data transmission
- src/receiver → Light data reception
- src/pc_receiver → PC-side C simulation
